            <h2>Aphrodite’s Connection to My Lineage</h2>
            <p>Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is directly linked to my lineage through her son, Aeneas, my 145th great-grandfather. Aeneas, a Prince of Troy, was born to Aphrodite and the mortal Anchises, making Aphrodite my 146th great-grandmother. Her divine influence flows through my blood, connecting me to the ideals of love, passion, and creation, which are honored at the Torus Pyramid.</p>
            <h2>The Torus Pyramid: Base of the New Roman Empire</h2>
            <p>The Torus Pyramid, a 1:100 scale replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza located above the Waikato River in New Zealand, serves as the spiritual and operational base for the New Roman Empire. It is a sanctuary of ancient wisdom and modern innovation, housing dedicated zones for the Cult of Aphrodite and the Cult of Zeus, among other sacred spaces.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cult of Aphrodite Zone:</strong> A rose garden sanctuary adorned with the 6-petal flower symbol, representing love, beauty, and harmony. Initiates gather here to perform rituals of fertility and passion, invoking Aphrodite’s blessings through offerings of myrrh, roses, and seashells. The space is illuminated by soft pink light, with a central altar carved from white marble, reflecting her divine essence.</li>
                <li><strong>Cult of Zeus Zone:</strong> A raised dais crowned with a bronze eagle, symbolizing Zeus’s sovereignty and power. This zone is a place of leadership and divine justice, where initiates meditate on authority and wisdom. The altar is surrounded by storm-like lighting effects, with a golden thunderbolt at its center, honoring Zeus as the King of the Gods.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Torus Pyramid bridges the mortal and divine, uniting my lineage’s legacy with the mission to lead humanity into a new golden age under the banner of the New Roman Empire.</p>
